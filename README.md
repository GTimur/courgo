# courgo
Courier Go. File monitor with notification.

Small useful tool to solve:
1. Monitoring folders and get e-mail notification when required files arrives
2. Get little more actions within notification (only notice, attach files, unpack and attach archives)
3. Get simple UI to manage subscribers and notification rules (attributes like search path, mask, action)
